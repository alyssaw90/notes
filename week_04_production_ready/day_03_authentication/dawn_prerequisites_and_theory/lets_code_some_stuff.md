#Lets code some stuff!

##bcrypt

Implement code to use bcrypt to encrypt a plain text string AND then use .compare() to check it.

##Sequelize validations

Implement a validation on your IMDB app, to require submitted comments to be between 20 and 200 characters. Test that it works.

##Sequelize hooks

Use sequelize hooks to convert all comments posted to your movie app to lowercase before they are created.

##Sessions

Use sessions to implement a back button on your movie app. The link should be on the movie detail page and link back to the watch list page OR search results page depending on which page they came from.

##Middleware

create a middleware that adds a function .getParamNames() to your req object. It should use Object.keys to return an array of all params on the current route.
