#Lets code some stuff!

Now we will be implementing in code, the topics you researched this morning. Come up with a working example, and be ready to teach the class.


##bcrypt

Implement code to use bcrypt to encrypt a plain text string AND then use `.compare()` to check it.

##Sequelize validations

Implement a validation on your IMDB app, to require submitted comments to be between `20` and `200` characters. Test that it works.

##Sequelize hooks

Use sequelize hooks to convert all comments posted to your movie app to lowercase before they are created.

##Sessions

Use sessions to implement a back button on your movie app. 

The link should be on the movie detail page and link back to the watch list page OR search results page depending on which page they came from.

##Middleware

Create a middleware that adds a parameter `.paramNames` to your `req` object. It should use Object.keys to get an array of all params on the current route.
